# JupyterLab Refresh View Extension - Journal

This journal tracks substantive work on the JupyterLab Refresh View Extension.

---

1. **Task - JupyterLab Refresh View Extension**: Implemented context menu refresh functionality for JupyterLab markdown and notebook files<br>
    **Result**: Created jupyterlab_refresh_view_extension from scratch using JupyterLab extension template (Copier v4.4.0). Implemented "Refresh View" command executing context.revert() to reload file content from disk with intelligent scroll position preservation (captures scroll state from .jp-RenderedMarkdown, .jp-Notebook, .jp-OutputArea-output elements, restores positions after 150ms rendering delay). Registered command with IDocumentManager (required), ICommandPalette and IFileBrowserFactory (optional dependencies). Added context menu integration using .jp-Document selector to cover all document types without duplication. Resolved TypeScript compilation errors (removed unused MarkdownDocument and NotebookPanel imports). Fixed duplicate menu item issue by consolidating 4 overlapping selectors (.jp-MarkdownViewer, .jp-RenderedMarkdown, .jp-NotebookPanel, .jp-FileEditor) into single parent selector (.jp-Document). Added dependencies to package.json: @jupyterlab/apputils, @jupyterlab/docmanager, @jupyterlab/docregistry, @jupyterlab/filebrowser, @jupyterlab/markdownviewer, @jupyterlab/notebook (all ^4.0.0). Used Makefile build system throughout: make install target handles version increment (0.1.0 -> 0.1.4), dependency installation (npm/yarn), TypeScript compilation, Python package build (hatch), and pip installation. Extension successfully installed and verified via jupyter labextension list showing jupyterlab_refresh_view_extension v0.1.4 enabled OK. Context menu "Refresh View" item appears once when right-clicking markdown/notebook content, enables only when document context exists, preserves scroll position during refresh, and integrates with command palette under "File Operations" category. Build infrastructure: TypeScript (strict mode), Jest unit tests, Playwright integration tests, ESLint/Prettier/Stylelint, GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows (build, test, release). Extension provides in-place file refresh without scrolling to top - critical for iterative document editing workflows.
