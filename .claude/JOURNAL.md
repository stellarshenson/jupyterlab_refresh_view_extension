# JupyterLab Refresh View Extension - Journal

This journal tracks substantive work on the JupyterLab Refresh View Extension.

---

1. **Task - JupyterLab Refresh View Extension**: Implemented context menu refresh functionality for JupyterLab markdown and notebook files<br>
    **Result**: Created jupyterlab_refresh_view_extension from scratch using JupyterLab extension template (Copier v4.4.0). Implemented "Refresh View" command executing context.revert() to reload file content from disk with intelligent scroll position preservation (captures scroll state from .jp-RenderedMarkdown, .jp-Notebook, .jp-OutputArea-output elements, restores positions after 150ms rendering delay). Registered command with IDocumentManager (required), ICommandPalette and IFileBrowserFactory (optional dependencies). Added context menu integration using .jp-Document selector to cover all document types without duplication. Resolved TypeScript compilation errors (removed unused MarkdownDocument and NotebookPanel imports). Fixed duplicate menu item issue by consolidating 4 overlapping selectors (.jp-MarkdownViewer, .jp-RenderedMarkdown, .jp-NotebookPanel, .jp-FileEditor) into single parent selector (.jp-Document). Added dependencies to package.json: @jupyterlab/apputils, @jupyterlab/docmanager, @jupyterlab/docregistry, @jupyterlab/filebrowser, @jupyterlab/markdownviewer, @jupyterlab/notebook (all ^4.0.0). Used Makefile build system throughout: make install target handles version increment (0.1.0 -> 0.1.4), dependency installation (npm/yarn), TypeScript compilation, Python package build (hatch), and pip installation. Extension successfully installed and verified via jupyter labextension list showing jupyterlab_refresh_view_extension v0.1.4 enabled OK. Context menu "Refresh View" item appears once when right-clicking markdown/notebook content, enables only when document context exists, preserves scroll position during refresh, and integrates with command palette under "File Operations" category. Build infrastructure: TypeScript (strict mode), Jest unit tests, Playwright integration tests, ESLint/Prettier/Stylelint, GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows (build, test, release). Extension provides in-place file refresh without scrolling to top - critical for iterative document editing workflows.

2. **Task - Package Metadata and Documentation**: Updated package metadata and comprehensive documentation for publishing<br>
    **Result**: Updated version from 0.1.4 to 0.6.2 in package.json. Added GitHub repository URLs: homepage (https://github.com/the-cog-conf/jupyterlab_refresh_view_extension), bugs tracker (/issues), and repository git URL. Improved package description from generic text to feature-focused: "JupyterLab extension adding context menu 'Refresh View' command to reload file content from disk while preserving scroll position". Enhanced README.md with professional structure: added GitHub Actions, npm, and PyPI badges with working links; created Features section highlighting context menu integration, scroll preservation, command palette access, and smart enable/disable; added Use Cases section covering iterative editing, live documentation, collaborative work, and build system integration; expanded Installation section with both PyPI and npm methods; added detailed Usage section with step-by-step instructions and command palette alternative. Created local project journal at .claude/JOURNAL.md documenting complete implementation history. Committed changes with conventional commit message and pushed to GitHub (commit 14fe948). Package now ready for publishing to npm and PyPI with complete metadata and user-facing documentation.

3. **Task - Package Publishing and Workflow Optimization**: Published extension to PyPI and streamlined GitHub Actions workflows<br>
    **Result**: Successfully published jupyterlab_refresh_view_extension v0.6.3 to PyPI using make publish (Makefile auto-incremented version from 0.6.2). Package available at https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlab-refresh-view-extension/0.6.3/ with wheel (28.3 kB) and source distribution (255.5 kB). Streamlined GitHub Actions workflows using .github/workflows.reference as template: simplified build.yml by removing lint and test steps, removed integration-tests and check_links jobs (keeping only essential build and test_isolated jobs), updated Python version from 3.9 to 3.12 in test_isolated job. Removed 5 unnecessary workflow files: check-release.yml, enforce-label.yml, prep-release.yml, publish-release.yml, update-integration-tests.yml. Final workflow structure matches reference pattern with minimal CI/CD overhead (build + isolated test only). Committed workflow changes (commit 4df0966) and pushed to GitHub. Extension now installable via pip install jupyterlab-refresh-view-extension with streamlined CI/CD pipeline.

4. **Task - Second PyPI Release**: Published v0.6.4 to PyPI and cleaned up repository<br>
    **Result**: Successfully published jupyterlab_refresh_view_extension v0.6.4 to PyPI using make publish in background (auto-incremented from 0.6.3). Package available at https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlab-refresh-view-extension/0.6.4/. Committed version bump to package.json and package-lock.json (commit 0146053). Removed .github/workflows.reference directory after successfully applying reference patterns to workflows. Extension now at v0.6.4 on PyPI with clean repository structure and optimized CI/CD pipeline.

5. **Task - v1.0.1 Stable Release**: First stable release with standardized badges and documentation<br>
    **Result**: Updated README.md badge from "Github Actions" to "GitHub Actions" (capital H) following GITHUB.md standards. Set version to 1.0.0 in package.json, then ran make publish which auto-incremented to v1.0.1 and published to PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlab-refresh-view-extension/1.0.1/). Extension now at stable v1.0.1 milestone with complete implementation: context menu "Refresh View" command, scroll position preservation, command palette integration, proper GitHub badges, comprehensive documentation, streamlined CI/CD workflow (build + test_isolated only). Committed release (commit c23dc28) and pushed to GitHub. Extension fully production-ready and installable via pip install jupyterlab-refresh-view-extension.

6. **Task - npm Package Publishing**: Published v1.0.2 to npm and PyPI registries<br>
    **Result**: Verified npm user is stellarshenson using npm whoami. Confirmed Makefile publishes to both npm (line 39: npm publish --access public) and PyPI (line 40: twine upload dist/*) as part of make publish target. Executed make publish which auto-incremented version from 1.0.1 to 1.0.2 and successfully published to both registries. Package now available at https://www.npmjs.com/package/jupyterlab_refresh_view_extension (v1.0.2) and https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlab-refresh-view-extension/ (v1.0.2). Extension installable via both npm install jupyterlab_refresh_view_extension and pip install jupyterlab-refresh-view-extension with identical functionality across package managers.
